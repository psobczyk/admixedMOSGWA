Version 1.2.1
-------------
Renamed "logistic" into "firth" regression_type, because that is what we use.

Version 1.2.0
-------------
Explicit configuration "regression_type". Defaults to linear!
Some further internal code disposal and improvements.

Version 1.1.9
-------------
Fixed phenotype counting bug in MData+GenotypeFrequ introduced in version 1.1.7.
Fixed score, previously sometimes dereferenced beyond its size.

Version 1.1.8
-------------
Refer to "memetic" instead of "genetic" algorithms.
Let search algorithms return best model found. (Not yet implemented for memetic algorithm.)
Fixed a bug in Model which might have led to inspection of fewer models after score tests when covariates were used.
Internal code improvements.

Version 1.1.7
-------------
Multiple internal code improvements.

Version 1.1.6
-------------
Internal code improvements which should simplify and slightly speed up the program.

Version 1.1.5
-------------
Added genotype caching to complement 1.1.3 memory use with higher speed. (Mind the new option cache_limit.)

Version 1.1.4
-------------
Incorporated updates to search strategy with genetic algorithms.

Version 1.1.3
-------------
New parameter correlation_threshold in section [output].
In the internals, dropped quite some data duplication from MData for more efficient memory use.

Version 1.1.2
-------------
Merged genetic algorithm code by Artur Gola.

Version 1.1.1
-------------
Added EBIC as a selection criterium.

Version 1.1.0
-------------
Changed configuration options around single marker tests and model selection criteria.
Prepare for further selection criteria.
Code cleanup.

Version 1.0.3
-------------
Some code cleanup.
In particular the experimental config parameters for "expected causal SNPs" for mBIC2 have been removed.
Parameter [model_selection]expected_causal_snps_MBIC now defaults to 20.


Version 1.0.2
-------------
Improved error output for Plink input.


Version 1.0.1
-------------
Improved default values.


Version 1.0.0
-------------
This is the first release version.
